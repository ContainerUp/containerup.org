# The easy way to manage containers

It's easy to run containers by using [Podman](https://podman.io/){:target="_blank"}.
With **ContainerUp**, it's even easier!

Operations done **in the browser**, without ~~complex command lines~~.

[Try ContainerUp demo](https://demo.containerup.org){: target="_blank" .btn .btn-primary .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 }
[Install now]({% link installation.md %}){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 }

## What is ContainerUp?

ContainerUp is an [open source](https://github.com/ContainerUp){:target="_blank"} tool
which makes it simple to manage containers with Podman in the browser.
You can complete most of the common operations with **just a few clicks**.
It's perfect to run ContainerUp on a single-node server, like your **VPS** or your **home server**.

This project is NOT intended for advanced users however,
as it's not possible or necessary to implement all of the features that Podman supports.
You need CLI or other tools sometimes. Check [features]({% link features.md %}) for what you can do with ContainerUp.
