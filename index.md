With **ContainerUp**, it's even easier!

Operations done **in the browser**, without ~~complex command lines~~.

## What is ContainerUp?

ContainerUp is an **open source** tool,
which makes it simple to manage containers with Podman in the browser.
You can complete most of the common operations with **just a few clicks**.

It's perfect to run ContainerUp on a single-node server,
like your [VPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server){:target="_blank" .external},
your **home server**, or even your [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com){:target="_blank" .raspberry-pi}.
